	<h1>Types,Values & Variables</h1>
	<p> The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as types, and one of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of types it supports. When a program needs to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to (or “stores” the value in) a variable. A variable defines a symbolic name for a value and allows the value to be referred to by name. The way that variables work is another fundamental characteristic of any programming language. </li>
	</p>
	<h2>Types</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: primitive types and object types.</li>
		<li>JavaScript’s primitive types include numbers, strings of text (known as strings), and Boolean truth values (known as booleans).</li>
		<li>The special JavaScript values null and undefined are primitive values, but they are not numbers, strings, or booleans</li>
		<li>Any JavaScript value that is not a number, a string, a boolean, or null or undefined is an object.</li>
		<li> An object (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value (either a primitive value, such as a number or string, or an object).</li>
		<li>An ordinary JavaScript object is an unordered collection of named values.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Numbers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike many languages, JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values.</li>
		<li>All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values.</li>
		<li>JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard,1 which means it can represent numbers as large as ±1.7976931348623157 × 10308 and as small as ±5 × 10−324.</li>
		<li>The JavaScript number format allows you to exactly represent all integers between −9007199254740992 (−253) and 9007199254740992 (253), inclusive.</li>
		<li>If you use integer values larger than this, you may lose precision in the trailing digits.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Interger Links</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In a JavaScript program, a base-10 integer is written as a sequence of digits.</br>
		 For example: 0</br> 3</br> 10000000</li>
		 <li>In addition to base-10 integer literals, JavaScript recognizes hexadecimal (base-16) values.</li>
		 <li>A hexadecimal literal begins with “0x” or “0X”, followed by a string of hexadecimal digits.</li>
		 <li>A hexadecimal digit is one of the digits 0 through 9 or the letters a (or A) through f (or F), which represent values 10 through 15.</li>
		 <li>Here are examples of hexadecimal integer literals: 0xff  // 15*16 + 15 = 255 (base 10) 0xCAFE911 Although the ECMAScript standard does not support them, some implementations of JavaScript allow you to specify integer literals in octal (base-8) format.</li>
		 <li>An octal literal begins with the digit 0 and is followed by a sequence of digits, each between 0 and 7.</br> For example: 0377  // 3*64 + 7*8 + 7 = 255 (base 10) Since some implementations support octal literals and some do not, you should never write an integer literal with a leading zero; you cannot know in this case whether an implementation will interpret it as an octal or decimal value.</li>
		 <li>In the strict mode of ECMAScript 5 (§5.7.3), octal literals are explicitly forbidden. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Floating-Points Literal</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Floating-point literals can have a decimal point; they use the traditional syntax for real numbers.</li>
		<li>A real value is represented as the integral part of the number, followed by a decimal point and the fractional part of the number.</li>
		<li>Floating-point literals may also be represented using exponential notation: a real number followed by the letter e (or E), followed by an optional plus or minus sign, followed by an integer exponent.</li>
		<li>This notation represents the real number multiplied by 10 to the power of the exponent.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Escape Sequences</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The backslash character (\) has a special purpose in JavaScript strings.</li>
		<li>Combined with the character that follows it, it represents a character that is not otherwise representable within the string.</li>
		<li>For example, \n is an escape sequence that represents a newline character.</li>
