	<h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight: italic">
		<ul >
			<li>JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The overwhelming majority of modern websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and smart phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most ubiquitous programming language in history.</li>
			<br>
			<li>JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behavior of web pages.</li>
		</ul>

			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;font-size: 20px">This will help you master the language. If you are already familiar with other programming languages, it may help you to know
	that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles.			
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript derives its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototypebased inheritance from Self. But you do not need to know any of those languages, or be familiar with those terms, to use this book and learn JavaScript.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The name “JavaScript” is actually somewhat misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblance, JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language.</li>
			<br>
			<li>And JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust and efficient general-purpose language.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
	<h2 style="color:green ;font-family: Verdana;font-weight: italic">History of Javascript</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>JavaScript: Names and Versions JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the Web, and technically, “JavaScript” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to describe Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language.</li>
	</br>
		<li>Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA—the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association—and because of trademark issues, the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name “ECMAScript.”</li>
		<br>
		<li>For the same trademark reasons, Microsoft’s version of the language is formally known as “JScript.” In practice, just about everyone calls the language JavaScript. </li>
		<br>
		<li>Here we uses the name “ECMAScript” only to refer to the language standard. For the last decade, all web browsers have implemented version 3 of the ECMAScript standard and there has really been no need to think about version numbers: the language standard was stable and browser implementations of the language were, for the most part, interoperable. Recently, an important new version of the language has been defined as ECMAScript version 5 and, at the time of this writing, browsers are beginning to implement it.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Here we covers all the new features of ECMAScript 5 as well as all the long-standing features of ECMAScript 3.</li>
		<br>
		<li>You’ll sometimes see these language versions abbreviated as ES3 and ES5, just as you’ll sometimes see the name JavaScript abbreviated as JS. When we’re speaking of the language itself, the only version numbers that are relevant are ECMAScript versions 3 or 5.</li>
		<br>
		<li>(Version 4 of ECMAScript was under development for years, but proved to be too ambitious and was never released.) Sometimes, however, you’ll also see a JavaScript version number, such as JavaScript 1.5 or JavaScript 1.8.</li>
		<br>
		<li>These are Mozilla’s version numbers: version 1.5 is basically ECMAScript 3, and later versions include nonstandard language extensions (see Chapter 11).</li>
		<br>
		<li>Finally, there are also version numbers attached to particular JavaScript interpreters or “engines.” Google calls its JavaScript interpreter V8, for example, and at the time of this writing the current version of the V8 engine is 3.0</li>
